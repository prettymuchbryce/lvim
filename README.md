# LunarVim Config

My LunarVim Config, inspired heavily by PasiBergman's [here](https://github.com/PasiBergman/lvim).

## What is this?

- [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org) is an opinionated, extensible,
  and fast IDE layer for **Neovim**.
- Neovim is a project/editor that seeks to aggressively refactor **Vim**.
- Vim is a highly configurable text editor.
